            in the engineering field. <b>B.Tech Biotech</b> is a very familiar
            course which has emerged in the field of science and technology.
            Biotechnology in engineering is a 4- year
            <b>undergraduate program</b> divided into 8 semesters which is
            amalgamating both life sciences, biological advancements in
            technology in order to study the micro-organisms or anti biotic to
            further utilize them for industrial process.

          <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            <b>Biotechnology</b> Is a major field which involves applied biology
            and scientific principles which involves the usage of advanced
            technology in the usage of living things in the field of
            <b>engineering, medicine, technology and other sources.</b>
            Biotechnology is a stream of which is a co-ordination of science and
            technology combining together to regulate new system in living
            organisms and other such things. B.Tech Biotech covers many topics
            such as micro biology, molecular biology, cell biotic, genetics and
            also technological subjects.

          <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            New technologies have been implemented in the industries which is
            now an emerging field of science and its principles for the advanced
            generation to effectively carry out those in many other industries.
            The most commonly used micro-biological techniques for DNA like PCR
            Polymerase Chain Reaction a technique used to make copies or replica
            of DNA, or molecular cloning to assemble DNA molecules or it could
            be MS Mass Spectrometry to sort ions based on their mass to charge

            All this was possible when two of the solid streams of science with
            biological knowledge and technological pinch with engineering
            standards was invented in the form of biotechnology. Biotechnology
            has now become a very renowned course as the importance we see in
            today’s world is enriched society for reducing infections and coming
            up with alternatives for complicated treatments. Biotechnology has
            many benefits and one among them is medical evolution and different
