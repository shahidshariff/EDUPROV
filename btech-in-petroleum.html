            <b>B.Tech Petroleum Engineering</b> is a 4 year under graduate
            course in the engineering streamlet. <b>Petroleum engineering</b> is
            a very vast stream that which deals with the study of
            <b
              >production of oil, petrol, gas and other elementary particles.</b
            >
            It is a very recent development in the field of technology and is
            one of the popular choices amongst young candidates. As we all know,
            petroleum is a form of natural element used for many reasons. We
            used petrol for transportation and to feed the vehicles as fuel and
            oil, petroleum to run heavy machineries for road oil, and stock for
            feeding chemicals and other synthetic materials that we use in our
            day to day life. <b>Petroleum</b> is used extensively in today`s
            modern world, not just as fuel for vehicles but also is widely used
            in various other products which are our basic necessities. Petroleum
            engineering has become a very outstanding course used for the
            development of various technicalities or improvements in the
            extraction of petroleum, computerized evaluation in processing,
            analytics and statistics, probability analysis and invention of new
            programming methods for better productivity and functioning.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            Petroleum engineering covers a wide arena of not just oil extraction
            but also involves the
            <b
              >study of oil drilling, seismology, tectonics, thermodynamics, oil
              processing, well logging, reservoir development and management
              etc.</b
            >
            petroleum engineering being 4 years, is further divided into 8
            semesters and is a very challenging field which requires consistency
            and course competency which elevates on skills, talents,
            persuasiveness and technical enhancement with creative evaluation.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            B.Tech Petroleum engineering is a very rare field and students those
            who actually want to pursue the field will choose this as their
            career. The petroleum engineering field gives more information on
            renewable and non -renewable sources of energy along with their
            properties. Petroleum engineering has other overlapping branches
            like mechanical, chemical and civil engineering.

                The <b>scope of petroleum engineering</b> is very vast and the
                spread of the course is humongous across the world. As we all
                know that petroleum being a necessary part of our daily lives,
                the scope for this industry is with multitudinous job
                opportunities. It requires the righteous skillset and the
                qualification in order to grab the forum of working in a
                multi-faceted industry where your qualification is the room to
                success. The flourishing petroleum industries in India has
                elevated and escalated the rise of engineers to work in these
                industries as India has a number of natural reservoirs and crude
                oil, minerals and natural gas manufacturing industries.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text text-dark mt-2">
                The scope of petroleum engineers even in abroad has been rising
                on a rapid level as gulf is the largest oil exporter and
                petroleum manufacturer and has been doing this since many
                centuries. Oil exporting industries are flourishing too and the
                employability ratio in such reservoirs is considerably high. Now
                there are many high-tech projects set up for the critical
                evaluation of oil and natural reservoirs. There are both on
                shore and off shore projects and all of them are high paying
                jobs. Many students complete their B.Tech petroleum engineering
                and apply for jobs in Gulf countries such as
                <b>Saudi Arabia, Oman, Dubai, Iran, Iraq etc.</b> all these
                marine projects stipulate on the site engineers and the pay
                scale is quite high. There are many public and private sector
                industries and corporations which provide various career
                opportunities to budding aspirants in crude oil refineries,
                petroleum industries etc.

                A degree in petroleum engineering can pave way for many careers
                and there is a global demand which is created for petroleum
                engineers. Many petroleum industries oil processing units offer
                jobs to aspiring petroleum engineers who can have access to
                various positions and profiles depending upon the necessity and
                calibre.

                Petroleum engineers are considered as the highest paid engineers
                in the field. There are plenty of jobs that a petroleum engineer
                can get into. They are mainly into designing and developing new
                technologies, they come up to strategize new techniques to
                enhance oil refineries, they maintain and manage the oil
                recovery machineries. They discover eco-friendly ways for
                extraction of oil and gas in an effective and efficient way to
                save the nature from any kind of destruction.
