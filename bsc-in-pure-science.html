          <b>Pure science</b> is one of the most important courses as we require it in our day to day life and
          it builds and improves our knowledge. Students can opt subjects related to physical sciences,
          mathematical science and natural sciences. Students who took up science streams in 11th and 12th
          require career advice and career counselling, mainly because they have so many options to choose
          from. I’m sure the students are not sure what subjects to take up, what stream is the best, which
          college is the best for their course etc. So, career counselling for science students
          helps them narrow down choices and choose the best college for taking admission there.


        </p>

        <p class="text-justify" id="paragraph-font">
          <b>Pure science</b> can mainly be divided into physical science, mathematical science
          and natural science.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify" id="paragraph-font">
          The best colleges and universities like <b> IITs, NITs, IISc (Indian Institute of Science)</b>,
          IISERs (Indian Institute of Scientific Education and research), BITS, NISER etc. offers
          integrated BS-MS degrees in pure science. Students will have to take up entrance exams
          for getting admission in these colleges. Here students finish both their undergraduate
          and master’s degrees in 5 years. The career options they have are discussed below. So,
          keep reading to know more about it.
