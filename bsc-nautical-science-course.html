          <strong>Nautical science</strong> the name itself makes many crazy. Yes!! As the name suggests it is the
          course that makes
          you spend your time near the sea. <b>B.Sc. Nautical Science </b>is a three-year undergraduate course that will
          lead you to work near
          the sea and also provides an opportunity to serve the nation when you join in the navy. This course provides
          you the knowledge
          of nautical technology, which is a must for a deck officer. One will get both the practical and theoretical
          knowledge in this
          course which will help for <b>cargo operation, maintenance of ships and navigation.</b> The course will also
          provide some knowledge
          about social studies and humanities. In this course, one will be trained in areas like <b>boat handling, rope
            climbing, and ladder
            climbing and sailing.</b>
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify" id="paragraph-font">

        </p>
        <p class="text-justify" id="paragraph-font">
          There are only two courses available in India to work on ships. So one should either opt for <b>marine
            engineering or B.Sc. Nautical Science,</b>
          knowing the difference between <b>Marine Engineering and Nautical Science </b>is a must in order to choose the
          one that suits you the best.
          One can become a <b>ship engineer if he chooses the marine engineering. </b>In the case of Nautical science,
          you will become a deck officer.
