            <b>B.Tech Marine Engineering</b> is one such branch of <b>engineering</b> which
            is expertise in <b>designing, building and construction of machine
            equipment’s for sea crafts, harbor installation, docks, all sea and
            water related operations.</b> Marine engineering is a <b>4 year under
            graduate course with 8 semesters,</b> exams subsequently being held
            every 6 months. This comes with practical sessions and theoretical
            sessions which provide students a co-operative method of learning.
            <b>Marine Engineering</b> is the field that studies about the production,
            designing, manufacturing, maintenance and operations of all ship
            mechanisms. It deals with both the internal and external
            technicalities of a body that sails on water. Many years ago, Marine
            engineering would have not even been known to many engineers but
            today, it is an established profession by many.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            There are many mechanisms that help in the operation or a ship like
            the electricity. Power generation system, propulsion mechanism,
            lubrication, water distillation, lighting and air conditioning
            system etc. All these activities are being taken care by the marine
            engineers who specialize in many fields. This engineering is sub
            ordinately linked with other engineering branches like mechanical,
            civil, electrical & electronics, computers etc. one such branch is
            that of marine engineering.

                skills not just in the field but also in industries of various
                marine fields like <b>shipping, steel industry, power sector,

                With the modernization in the trade sector occurring between
                countries through water ways, the need for different sea
                instruments and machines have come into existence. To operate
                and build in new technologies, to globalize trade and to re
                amend the usual technologies, young and multi-faceted marine
                engineers have high demand for jobs. The increase in the
                employment opportunities has lured many individuals to opt this
                course as their career. Both the specializations like merchant
                navy and armed navy have great opportunities for this field.

                <b>Marine engineers</b> can swap to being an armed navy foregoing a

                engineering is a good field of study for budding young minds to
                opt and if such interest and skills are put together will
                definitely go on to leave an ineradicable mark on the
