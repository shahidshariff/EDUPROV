                    JEE Mains was formerly called as (AIEEE) All India Engineering Entrance Examination which was conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA). AIEEE was introduced in the year 2002 and later was renamed as JEE in April 2013 for admissions to a wide choice of undergraduate engineering and architectural courses in prestigious and notable NIT`s National Institute of Technology and IIT`s Indian Institute of Information Technology. 
                  </p>
                  <p  class="text-justify  text-dark mt-4">
                    From the year 2019, NTA decided to give the candidates 2 attempts to pass the exam. But for 2021, the exam is set to be conducted 4 times since 2020 was a pandemic year as exam wasn’t held in the previous year. So, candidates can appear in any one of the 4 sessions as conducted by the NTA.
                    Once a candidate is meeting the percentile he/ she is eligible to get admissions in top engineering colleges that they are willing to go in.
