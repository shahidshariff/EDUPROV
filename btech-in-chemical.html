            <b>B.Tech in Chemical Engineering</b> is a very vast field in the
            engineering spectrum. <b>Chemical engineering</b> is usually chosen by
            students those who have an inclination towards chemistry and
            chemical components. B.Tech Chemical Engineering is a <b>4 year under
            graduate</b> course that deals with the principles and laws governing
            physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology and economics, their
            mechanisms, their conversion of chemicals into raw components with
            the use of nano technology and bio technology for raising industries
            to develop better end products. Chemical Engineering stipulates on
            the producing and processing of new technologies and replacing them
            with the old and existing technologies. Chemical Engineering and its
            techniques make our lives a lot easier and chemical engineers work
            towards it.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            B.Tech Chemical Engineering is a course designed to impact the
            chemical engineering concepts for chemical management and its
            efficient usage, chemical engineering also involves problem solving
            techniques in the chemical industry, in production and use of
            chemicals. It draws a line of similarities between science and its
            application for developing and designing new techniques in
            manufacturing sectors. Chemical Engineering aims in providing the
            candidates full- fledged knowledge on chemical, its applications,
            reactions and its usage in different usage in different units and
            sectors. They are given in-depth knowledge of production
            development, chemical plants and operation equipment’s evolved in
            chemical processing plants, wherein students gain widespread
            knowledge of their job roles in both public and private sector.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            Chemical Engineering requires the students to have good observatory
            skills, perseverance towards the subjects and more skill oriented as
            the subjects evolves a lot of theoretical knowledge which is used
            practically in laboratories to discover new reactions. Chemical
            engineering being a 4- year UG course is further divided into 8
            semester and students must have crucial knowledge analysis about
            <b>physics, chemistry, biology and micro biology with all other
            relevant concepts.</b>
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            Students who pursue chemical engineering need to have <b>good

                The <b>scope for chemical engineers</b> has expanded rapidly over the
                past few years with the expansion of <b>scientific knowledge and
                applying science, and specifically chemistry to develop newer
                technology has increased astronomically.</b> This has led to a
                massive increase in chemical engineering profession. The scope
                has tentatively grown and is tend to grow in future due to the
                industrial expansion and the scarcity of resources. Chemical
                engineers might be in demand in the upcoming days. Chemical
                engineers design, develop and operate chemical plants and their
                production and help in improvising the quality of production.

              <p class="card-text text-dark mt-2">
                Chemical engineering is a wide branch that covers topics from
                other branches as well such as nanotechnology and bio
                technology, mineral based industries to develop and gratify
                minerals and chemicals, pharmaceuticals, synthetic fibres,
                petroleum refining plants and other techniques for development
                of minerals and other resources.

              <p class="card-text text-dark mt-2">
                The main responsibility of <b>chemical engineer</b> is to invent,
                develop and redesign to operate the management of different
                processes in various industries. Chemical engineers are mainly
                responsible for operating chemical plants and coming up with
                solutions to problems for dealing with best methods of
                production.

                After the completion of B.Tech in chemical engineering students
                can opt either for their higher studies or post- graduation or
                get a job in a private or government- based industry. The salary
                packages of chemical engineers are also considerably very high.
                Students can depend on various specializations and get expertise
                in various field such as petrochemicals and material sciences.
