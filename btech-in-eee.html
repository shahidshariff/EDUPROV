            <b>B.Tech in Electronics and Electrical Engineering (EEE)</b> is a major course under the engineering orbit. The B. Tech EEE program is a 4 year <b>under graduate program</b> which is a technically skilled index widely opted by many students all over the world, which is a mixed combination of electronics and electrical knowledge. B. Tech in Electronics and Electrical Engineering has widespread knowledge on electronics and electrical components and deals with areas like designing and maintaining of electrical machines, electrical appliances, electrical sockets, circuit design, vehicle electrical manufacturing, electronic device manufacturing, automation design, power house maintenance, Hydro electric plant and much more concerned with electrical and electronics. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
             <b>B.Tech EEE</b> deals with the standardization in the technological and electrical aspects in a computerized format. As the world getting more and more innovated thus the need to understand the circuits and technologically skilled electrical devices knowledge should be escalated. EEE involves the use of power in all its components. Power can be involved in turbines hydro, gas, fuel, bio solar, wind solar, or geo thermal energy and to run wind mills. As the name is Electronics and Electrical but also involves study in mechanical, computer and communication field.

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p class="text-justify">
            The admission process in B. Tech EEE the student must fulfill the above stated eligibility criteria. In order to get admissions in B. Tech  EEE program students need to appear in the entrance exams and get a qualifying rank to get a cost effective admission process. Some of the few popular entrance exams are: 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>KCET</li>
            <li>JEE Mains</li>
            <li>JEE Advanced</li>
            <li>COMED K</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-justify">
            <b>Students</b> need to attend any of these entrance exams in order to <b>get admissions in top colleges</b>. Entrance exams act as a gateway for students which requires them to attend the exam so that they prove their eligibility for the course. There will be a cut off percentage and the students need to score a minimum near to the cut off and if they`re scoring more than the cut off the fees can be less and they will have added benefits if they score in merit and can choose amongst a list of best colleges.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Now there are certain other eminent universities which conduct their own entrance exams. Those can be called as university level entrance exams. As the universities are approved and desired by many students and the colleges will be running high on demand so as the level of competition. Some of the few university level entrance exams are -
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>BITSAT Birla Institute of Science and  Technology Admission Test </li>
            <li>SRM JEEE SRM joint entrance examination </li>
            <li>PESSAT PES Scholastic Aptitude Test</li>
            <li>MET (Manipal Entrance Test)</li>
            <li>VITEEE Vellore Institute of Technology Engineering Entrance Examination</li>
            <li>DSAT Dayanand Sagar Admission Test </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Students those who are planning to do engineering can apply for <a href="https://eduprov.com/jee-exam-blog.html"><b>JEE Mains</b></a> right after their 12th examination. For students who want to get admissions into the prestigious universities like NIT`s IIT`s need to qualify JEE Mains along with <b>JEE Advanced</b> to get a seat as the stakes of competition are  quiet high. The other alternative is getting admission through management quota for which student has to be eligible.
