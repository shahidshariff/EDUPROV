              B.Tech Dairy Technology is a very prominent field in the
              engineering stream. Dairy Technology has gone to improvise in its
              techniques and process along with innovation which gives an
              evaluating scheme to the candidates those who choose the stream.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
              B.Tech Dairy Technology is a 4-year undergraduate degree course
              which studies the processing of milk and its products. It studies
              the various aspects of milk products, their production, processing
              and manufacturing of all kinds of dairy products. Dairy Technology
              involves the scientific and engineering principles for standard
              development of dairy products using the biochemistry and
              bacteriology principles to improve the dairy farming and products.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
              The 4-year undergraduate course is divided into 8 semesters in
              which students are taught about new methods needed to discover and
              manufacture different milk products and its by-products such as
              cheese, butter, creamery and creams which involves the
              implementation of scientific principles and engineering
              technology.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
              B.Tech Dairy Technology is also a major field of food processing
              and technology. This field is very appropriate for those students
              who really are interested in building a career in dairy field and
              dairy products. Those students who are confused to choose any
              course that suits their skills can opt for professional career
              counseling from Eduprov where assistance to students will be given
              from the scratch until they get into the best college for
              admissions.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
              Dairy Technology field plays a very pivotal role in the country’s
              economy and growth in agriculture. As the rapid expansion has
              given rise to huge demand for students in dairy technology sector.
              Students are given extensive training on managing heavy dairy
              manufacturing product machineries, their processing and also are
              given knowledge on the engineering aspects of dairy technology and
              farming.

                For those students who are willing to pursue a career in dairy
                technology engineering can get admissions into the stream
                through two aspects: one is by attending entrance exams and the
                other one is through direct admission that is through management
                quota.
              </p>

              <p class="text-justify text-dark">
                There is a list of entrance examinations that students can
                attend based on what state they belong to. Entrance exams are
                conducted state level, national level and university level.
                Students after writing the examination wait for results. Every
                course has a cut-off percentage and predicting the cut-off would
                not be that easy as it varies from university to university.
                Thus, there is a counseling round, then seat allotment and
                interview round and then the best ones make it to top
                universities.
              </p>

              <p class="text-justify text-dark">
                If students are looking out for direct admissions then they can
                just select the college and course and apply directly on the
                college`s official portal and pay the admission fee. They just
                have to fulfil the basic eligibility criteria that the college
                has set.
