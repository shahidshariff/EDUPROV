            <b>B.Tech Aeronautical Engineering</b> is a professional course in the engineering streamlet which deals with the principles of an aircraft, spacecraft, its modules, variants, their technicalities and their flying abilities. Aeronautical Engineering teaches the design and development of an aircraft/ spacecraft. It studies about the physical properties behind a space shuttle, a rocket, flying planes, the science which is being implemented in order to fly all these huge objects, the aerodynamics structure and their physical aspects. This particular stream of engineering deals with the modern and recent adaptations of various analysis on these huge objects and comes up with strategies to be confined to not just the old modules but to develop a better and enhanced structure for a more effective future of flying planes

              <p class="card-text text-dark"  id="paragraph-font">
                One way of getting admissions for Aeronautical Engineering is through entrance test. Either national level entrance exams, or state level entrance exams. Also there are certain institutions which conduct their own entrance exams. Students can opt for such colleges or universities as well. These are all private institutions and also are well reputed. The procedure is basically like it holds entrance test and they set a particular cut off percentile. The students just has to qualify and get admissions followed by a counseling session.

              <p class="card-text text-dark" id="paragraph-font">
                Another way of getting Admissions in Aeronautical Engineering is through direct admissions or management quota. 
                For this the students just have to fulfill the basic eligibility criteria of the college and get a seat. Entrance exam 
                score isn’t required in this scenario. Colleges reserve certain number of seats for management. This seat would definitely 
                cost a fortune as students need to just be eligible.
