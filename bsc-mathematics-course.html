         <b>B.Sc Mathematics</b> is the study of quantity, structure, space, and change. B.Sc. Mathematics or Bachelor of Science
          in Mathematics is a three-year undergraduate Mathematics course that provides a wide knowledge of mathematics.
          Mathematicians seek out patterns and formulate new conjectures. This course is a career-oriented course in
          nature. This degree covers some of the major topics that we have known some at the basic level from one's
          childhood.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Subjects offered in this course include Algebra, Integral Calculus & Trigonometry, Vector Analysis & Geometry,
          Different Equations, Mechanics, Mathematical Methods, Numerical Analysis, Differential Geometry, and Advanced
          Calculus, etc.. Mathematical equations can be applied directly to build applications in coding and cryptology,
          mathematical physics, mathematical biology, Bioinformatics, and finance.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Mathematics is the basis of life. Everything in our life is related to mathematical calculations. The scope of
          this course doesn't diminish. One who has opted for B.Sc. Mathematics can opt for several other courses such
          as MBA, etc. Or can even join in the Engineering discipline upon completion.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Do you love calculations? Are you a genius in Maths in your school, then this course fits you perfectly. This
          doesn't mean that the one who is genius can only apply everyone who satisfies the eligibility condition of the
          institution can apply for this course. Experts from EDUPROV will help you to know about the colleges that
          provide this course along with the facilities available in the institution and its ranking. We will not only
          provide the information required for you but also will assist you in case of getting admission. The process
          starts with the guidance to fill the application for assistance in the counseling.
